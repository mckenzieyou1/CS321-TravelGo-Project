TravelGo
## Description
TravelGo was created by four computer scientist students during their study abroad in Vienna Austria. 
This travel app was created to enhance tourists travels in Vienna. We came up with this idea because Professor Pettit encourages free time, but we aren't always sure 
how best to spend our time in this new and exciting city. As a result of these deliemmas, we created TravelGo so tourists visiting Vienna can maximize their travels and ensure they have a good, unique visit. TravelGo lets users personalize their day to day activities and creates a fun interactive user expereience while exposing vistors to hidden gems in the beautiful city of Vienna, Austria! While the project focuses on Vienna, Austria this applicaton is versatile and can be used anywhere!
Users are able to select locations from the categories of Cafes, Musesuems, Resturants, and Churches. There is also an option to filter these locations based on price range and distance.
